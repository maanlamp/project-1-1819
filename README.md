## Concept

This repo contains a webapp built to showcase possible improvements to the autosuggest feature for the OBA. It also searches for items in the database, and allows for more casual browsing through suggested items based on your search, and suggested categories.

### Features
The concept is based on a couple of concise but important features.

#### Autocompletion
Autocompletion now not only suggests titles, it gets a coverimage and a short description aswell.

I'm getting funny feelings ðŸ¤¤.

## Getting started
To get searching, firstly clone the repo.

Then, install dependencies:
```shell
npm i
```

Then, run some form of a server to host the webapp. I recommend [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
